INSTRUCTIONS
============
Write a professional resume summary that:

1. LENGTH: 40-50 words maximum. Be extremely concise. The summary above is the ideal length.

2. STRUCTURE: Follow this pattern:
   - Opening: "[Identity] with deep experience [doing what]"
   - Middle: List 2-3 concrete capability areas using gerunds (building, leading, driving)
   - Close: "Known for [signature strength]" or similar differentiator

3. STYLE:
   - Executive, direct tone
   - Use "deep experience", "extensive background", or similar depth language
   - NO years of experience (age discrimination concern)
   - NO em-dashes
   - NO semicolons
   - NO buzzwords (passionate, proven track record, results-driven, dynamic, innovative)
   - NO first person (I am, I have)
   - DO NOT over-tailor to the specific job - keep it general enough to be authentic

4. CONTENT:
   - Stay close to the candidate's actual identity and strengths
   - Subtly align with 1-2 job priorities without being obvious
   - Focus on genuine capabilities, not keyword stuffing
   - The summary should feel natural and authentic, not manufactured for ATS

OUTPUT FORMAT
=============
Return ONLY the summary text. No explanation, no quotes, no bullet points. Just the summary paragraph.
